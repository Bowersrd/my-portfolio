                As you might have noticed by the big text, my name is Reggie Bowers.

                degree in Criminal Justice.</p>

                I am currently working with Spear Interactive on a football video game called Varsity: High School Football as the Lead Gameplay Developer and UI/UX Developer. I am well versed in C# and
                JavaScript/TypeScript. I work in C# during the day and at nights, I focus heavily on JavaScript and even freelance creating websites. Please check out all my projects to see
                the versatility I bring to my teams.</p>

                I bring leadership quality to any team that I work on, something I
                have strengthened through my current profession. Being self taught is my greatest strength as it has allowed me to really push myself
                to the limits learning so many different languages and learning the most
                important part of programming, to never stop learning. Let's take some designs and bring them to life!</p>
