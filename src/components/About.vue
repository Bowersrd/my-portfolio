            As you might have noticed by the big text, my name is Reggie Bowers.
            I am a graduate from East Tennessee State University with a bachelor’s
            degree in Criminal Justice. Criminal Justice??? That’s right, for the last
            seven (7) plus years, I have been working in the criminal justice field.</p>
        <p class="mt-5 leading-relaxed md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            I have been a self taught developer for several years and have
            dedicated all the free time I have outside of my current profession
            and home life to coding. Coding is something I quickly fell in love with and my main front end strength is
            with Vue. I am very familiar with Vue 2 but have quickly began to love Vue 3 with all the new updates. I am
            a programmer who loves new challenges and never stops learning. I build websites, I work with electron to
            create desktop applications, and I also mess around in Unity with C#.</p>
        <p class="mt-5 leading-relaxed md:text-lg lg:text-xl">
            I bring leadership quality to any team that I work on, something I
            have strengthed through my current profression. Being self taught is my greatest strength, that might sound
            crazy, but being a self taught programmer has allowed me to really push myself
            to the limits learning so many different languages and learning the most
            important part of programming, where on stackoverflow I can find the
            answer to my problem. Let's take some designs and bring them to life!</p>
